These three files are the most current "working" CFF and OTF
fonts based on the work on this page. They are unlikely to
work "as fonts", but they should validate through tx, TTX,
and Microsoft's "Font Validator" program.

  customfont.cff  - CFF-only data block
  customfont.otf  - OpenType font with embedded CFF data block
  customfont.woff - WOFF-wrapped version of Customfont.otf

For those burdened by lawyers, these fonts are license-free,
and supplied as-is. I hold no responsibility for your what
you do with these files. Although I might like to know about
it if you do something particularly cool with them.

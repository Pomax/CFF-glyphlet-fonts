<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This document specifies the WOFF font packaging format.
This format was designed to provide lightweight, easy-to-implement compression of font data,
suitable for use with CSS <tt>@font-face</tt> rules.
Any properly licensed TrueType/OpenType/Open Font Format file can be packaged in WOFF format for Web use.
User agents decode the WOFF file to restore the font data such that it will display identically to the input font.</p>

<p>The WOFF format also allows additional metadata to be attached to the file;
this can be used by font designers or vendors to include licensing or other information,
beyond that present in the original font.
Such metadata does not affect the rendering of the font in any way,
but may be displayed to the user on request.</p>

<p>The WOFF format is not intended to replace other formats
such as TrueType/OpenType/Open Font Format or SVG fonts,
but provides an alternative solution for use cases where these formats may be less optimal,
or where licensing considerations make their use less acceptable.</p>

<p>The CR exit criteria were:</p>
<ol><li>Sufficient reports of implementation experience have been gathered to demonstrate that the “WOFF File Format 1.0” syntax and features are implementable and are interpreted in a consistent manner. To do so, the Working Group would insure that all features have been implemented in at least two implementation in an interoperable way.</li>
<li>The implementations have been developed independently.</li>

<div class="main">

<h2 id="Introduction">1.&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p>This document specifies a simple compressed file format for fonts, designed
primarily for use on the Web and known as WOFF (Web Open Font Format).
Despite this name, WOFF should be regarded as a container format
or "wrapper" for font data in already-existing formats
rather than an actual font format in its own right.</p>

<p>The WOFF format is a container for the table-based sfnt structure used in e.g. TrueType [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-TT">TrueType</a></cite>], OpenType [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-OT">OpenType</a></cite>] and Open Font Format [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-OFF">OFF</a></cite>] fonts, hereafter referred to as sfnt fonts. 

A WOFF file is simply a repackaged
version of a sfnt font with optional compression of the font data tables.
The WOFF file format also allows font metadata and private-use data to be
included separately from the font data. WOFF encoding tools convert an input
sfnt font into a WOFF formatted file, and user agents restore the
sfnt font data for use with a Web document.</p>

<p>The structure and contents of decoded font data exactly match
those of a well-formed input font file. Tools producing WOFF files may provide other
font editing features such as glyph subsetting, validation or font feature
additions but these are considered outside the scope of this format. Independent
of these features, both tools and user agents are expected to assure that the validity of
the underlying font data is preserved.</p>

<h3 id="Notation">Notational Conventions</h3>

<p>The all-uppercase key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-RFC-2119">RFC-2119</a></cite>].
If these words occur in lower- or mixed case, they should be interpreted
in accordance with their normal English meaning.
</p>

<p>This document includes sections of text that are called out as "Notes"
and set off from the main text of the specification.
These notes are intended as informative explanations or clarifications,
to serve as hints or guides to implementers and users,
but are not part of the normative text.
</p>


<h2 id="General">2.&nbsp;General Requirements</h2>

<p>The primary purpose of the WOFF format is to package fonts linked to Web documents
by means of CSS <tt>@font-face</tt> rules.
User agents supporting the WOFF file format for linked fonts must respect
the requirements of the CSS3 Fonts specification ([<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-CSS3-Fonts">CSS3-Fonts</a></cite>] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-face-rule">Section 4.1:
The @font-face rule</a>). In particular,
<span class="conform ua" id="conform-css3font-available">such linked fonts are only available to the documents that reference them;
they MUST NOT be made available to other applications or documents on the user's system</span>.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>The WOFF format is intended for use with <tt>@font-face</tt>
to provide fonts linked to specific Web documents.
Therefore, WOFF files must not be treated as an installable font format
in desktop operating systems or similar environments.
The WOFF-packaged data will typically be decoded to sfnt format
for use by existing font-rendering APIs that expect OpenType font data,
but such decoded font must not be exposed to other documents or applications.
</p>
</div>


<h2 id="OverallStructure">3.&nbsp;Overall File Structure</h2>

<p>The structure of WOFF files is similar to the structure of sfnt fonts:
a table directory containing lengths and offsets to individual font data tables,
followed by the data tables themselves. The sfnt structure is described fully in
the TrueType [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-TT">TrueType</a></cite>], OpenType [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-OT">OpenType</a></cite>] and Open Font Format [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-OFF">OFF</a></cite>] specifications.</p>

<p>The main body of the file consists of the same collection of font data tables
as the input sfnt font, stored in the same order, except
that <span class="conform ff" id="conform-maycompress">each table MAY be compressed</span>, and the sfnt table directory is replaced by
the WOFF table directory.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>The WOFF specification does not guarantee that the actual font data
packaged in a valid WOFF container is in fact correct and usable.
It requires only that the WOFF packaging structure—header, table directory,
and compressed tables—conforms to this specification.
The contained data must be used with just as much caution as font data
delivered in "raw" form or via any other packaging method.</p>
</div>

<p>A complete WOFF file consists of several blocks: a 44-byte header,
immediately followed (in this order) by a variable-size table directory,
a variable number of font tables, an optional block of extended
metadata, and an optional block of private data.
Except for padding with a maximum of three null bytes
in places where 4-byte alignment of a table length
or block offset is specified,
<span class="conform ff" id="conform-noextraneous">there MUST NOT be any extraneous data between the data blocks
or font data tables indicated by the WOFF header and table directory,
or beyond the last such block or table</span>.
If such extraneous data is present <span class="conform ua" id="conform-extraneous-reject">a conforming user agent
MUST reject the file as invalid</span>.
The file <span class="conform ua" id="conform-overlap-reject">MUST also be rejected as invalid
if the offsets and lengths of any data blocks or font tables
indicate overlapping byte ranges of the file,
or ranges that would extend beyond the end of the file</span>.</p>

<table>
<colgroup><col class="name"><col class="desc">
</colgroup><tbody><tr class="header"><th colspan="2">WOFF File</th></tr>
<tr><td>WOFFHeader</td><td>File header with basic font type and version, along
with offsets to metadata and private data blocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TableDirectory</td><td>Directory of font tables, indicating the original
size, compressed size and location of each table within the WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FontTables</td><td>The font data tables from the input sfnt
font, compressed to reduce bandwidth requirements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ExtendedMetadata</td><td>An optional block of extended metadata,
represented in XML format and compressed for storage in the WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PrivateData</td><td>An optional block of private data for the font
designer, foundry, or vendor to use.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Data values stored in the WOFF Header and WOFF Table Directory sections are
stored in big-endian format, just as values are within sfnt fonts. The
following basic data types are used in the description:</p>
<table>
<colgroup><col class="type"><col class="desc">
</colgroup><tbody><tr class="header"><th colspan="2">Data types</th></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integer in big-endian
format</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>16-bit (2-byte) unsigned integer in big-endian
format</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>All sizes and offsets described in this document are assumed to be in bytes unless
otherwise noted.</p>


<h2 id="WOFFHeader">4.&nbsp;WOFF Header</h2>

<p>The header includes an identifying signature and indicates the specific kind
of font data included in the file (TrueType or CFF outline data); it also has a
font version number, offsets to additional data chunks, and the number of
entries in the table directory that immediately follows the header:</p>

<table>
<colgroup><col class="type"><col class="name"><col class="desc">
</colgroup><tbody><tr class="header"><th colspan="3">WOFFHeader</th></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>signature</td><td>0x774F4646 <tt>'wOFF'</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>flavor</td><td>The "sfnt version" of the input font.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>length</td><td>Total size of the WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>numTables</td><td>Number of entries in directory of font
tables.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>reserved</td><td>Reserved; set to zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>totalSfntSize</td><td>Total size needed for the
uncompressed font data, including the sfnt header, directory,
and font tables (including padding).</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>majorVersion</td><td>Major version of the WOFF
file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>minorVersion</td><td>Minor version of the WOFF
file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>metaOffset</td><td>Offset to metadata block, from
beginning of WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>metaLength</td><td>Length of compressed metadata block.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>metaOrigLength</td><td>Uncompressed size of metadata
block.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>privOffset</td><td>Offset to private data block, from
beginning of WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>privLength</td><td>Length of private data block.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-magicnumber">The <tt>signature</tt> field in the WOFF header
MUST contain the "magic number" 0x774F4646</span>.
<span class="conform ua" id="conform-nomagicnumber-reject">If the field does not contain this value,
user agents MUST reject the file as invalid</span>.</p>

<p>The <tt>flavor</tt> field corresponds to the "sfnt version"
field found at the beginning of an sfnt file,
indicating the type of font data contained.
Although only fonts of type 0x00010000 (the version number 1.0
as a 16.16 fixed-point value, indicating TrueType glyph data)
and 0x4F54544F (the tag <tt>'OTTO'</tt>, indicating CFF glyph data)
are widely supported at present, it is not an error in the WOFF file if the
<tt>flavor</tt> field contains a different value, indicating a
WOFF-packaged version of a different sfnt flavor. (The value 0x74727565 <tt>'true'</tt>
has been used for some TrueType-flavored fonts on Mac
OS, for example.) Whether client software will actually support other types of
sfnt font data is outside the scope of the WOFF specification, which
simply describes how the sfnt is repackaged for Web use.</p>

<p>The WOFF <tt>majorVersion</tt> and <tt>minorVersion</tt> fields specify the version number for a given
WOFF file, which can be based on the version number of the input font but is
not required to be. These fields have no effect on font loading or usage
behavior in user agents.</p>

<p>The <tt>totalSfntSize</tt> field is the sum of the
uncompressed font table sizes, each padded to a multiple of 4 bytes, plus
the size of the sfnt header and table directory. Thus, this is the size of
buffer needed to decode the complete WOFF-packaged font (but not metadata,
which is not part of the input sfnt file) into a standard sfnt structure.
<span class="conform ff" id="conform-totalsize-longword">This value MUST be a multiple of 4, because all font tables
including the last are to be padded to a 4-byte boundary</span>. 
<span class="conform ua" id="conform-totalsize-longword-reject">If this value
is incorrect, a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as invalid</span>.</p>

<p>The sfnt header includes three fields (<tt>searchRange</tt>,
<tt>entrySelector</tt> and <tt>rangeShift</tt>) that are designed to
facilitate a binary search of the table directory.
As the proper value for each of these fields can be computed directly
from the number of font tables, they are not stored in the WOFF file.
User agents that decode WOFF files back to an sfnt structure
MUST therefore compute the correct values for these fields in the sfnt header,
as described in the OpenType/OFF specification.[<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-OFF">OFF</a></cite>]</p>

<div class="note">
<p>The correct value for <tt>totalSfntSize</tt> may be computed
as illustrated by the following pseudo-code:</p>
<pre>totalSfntSize = 12 // size of sfnt header ("offset table" in the OpenType spec)
totalSfntSize += 16 * numTables // size of table record (directory of font tables)
for each table:
    totalSfntSize += (table.origLength + 3) &amp; 0xFFFFFFFC // table size, padded
</pre>
</div>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-zerometaprivate">If either or both of the metadata or private blocks is not present,
the relevant offset and length fields MUST be set to zero</span>.
<span class="conform ua" id="conform-metaprivate-overlap-reject">If the metadata or private data offset and length fields indicate byte
ranges that overlap other data blocks or tables,
or extend beyond the end of the file,
a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as invalid</span>.</p>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-reserved">The header includes a <tt>reserved</tt> field; this MUST be
set to zero</span>. <span class="conform ua" id="conform-reserved-reject">If this field is non-zero, a conforming user agent
MUST reject the file as invalid</span>.</p>


<h2 id="TableDirectory">5.&nbsp;Table Directory</h2>

<p>The table directory is an array of WOFF table directory entries, as defined
below. The directory follows immediately after the WOFF file header; therefore,
there is no explicit offset in the header pointing to this block. Its size is
calculated by multiplying the <tt>numTables</tt> value in the
WOFF header times the size of a single WOFF table directory.  Each table
directory entry specifies the size and location of a single font data table.</p>

<table>
<colgroup><col class="type"><col class="name"><col class="desc">
</colgroup><tbody><tr class="header"><th colspan="3">WOFF TableDirectoryEntry</th></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>tag</td><td>4-byte sfnt table identifier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>offset</td><td>Offset to the data, from beginning of WOFF
file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>compLength</td><td>Length of the compressed data,
excluding padding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>origLength</td><td>Length of the uncompressed table,
excluding padding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>origChecksum</td><td>Checksum of the uncompressed
table.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The format of <tt>tag</tt> values are defined by the
specifications for sfnt fonts. The <tt>offset</tt> and
<tt>compLength</tt> fields identify the location of the
compressed font table. The <tt>origLength</tt> and <tt>origCheckSum</tt>
fields are the length and checksum of the
input font table from the table directory of the input
font.</p>

<p>The sfnt format specifications require that font tables be aligned on
4-byte boundaries. Font tables whose length is not a multiple of 4 are padded
with null bytes up to the next 4-byte boundary. <span class="conform ff" id="conform-tablesize-longword">Font data tables in the WOFF
file have the same requirement: they MUST begin on 4-byte boundaries and be
zero-padded to the next 4-byte boundary</span>. The <tt>compLength</tt> and <tt>origLength</tt> fields
in the table directory store the exact, unpadded length.</p>

<p>If the <tt>offset</tt> and <tt>compLength</tt> values
indicate a byte range that overlaps
other data blocks or font tables, or if the byte range extends beyond
the end of the file, <span class="conform ua" id="conform-diroverlap-reject">a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as
invalid</span>.</p>

<p><span class="conform at ff" id="conform-compressedlarger">If the length of a compressed font table would be the same as or greater than
the length of the input font table, the font table MUST be stored

<p>The sfnt font specifications require that table directory entries

<p>sfnt fonts store a checksum for each table in the table directory, and
an overall checksum for the entire font in the <tt>head</tt>

<!-- next para could be reworded to add a conformance clause -->
<p>A WOFF file contains the same set of font tables as the input font
from which it was created. This means that the overall font checksum of a
font decompressed from a conformant WOFF file will always match the checksum
in the well-formed input font. In the case where the
input font included unreferenced data between or after the actual tables,
this would affect the overall checksum of the input font, but would be
dropped during creation of the WOFF file.</p>

<!-- next para could be reworded to add a conformance clause -->
<p>A well-formed input font does not have structural anomalies such as
incorrect padding, overlapping font tables, 
extraneous data between tables (which will be discarded by the WOFF
generator), or incorrect checksums. </p>

<p>To ensure that lossless round-trip conversion from sfnt to WOFF and back
will be possible, a well-formed input font should conform
to certain norms that are not
strictly required by the OpenType/OFF specification, although they are common
practice:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Font table padding</dt>
<dd>The OpenType/OFF specification is not entirely clear about whether <em>all</em>
tables in an sfnt font must be padded with 0-3 zero bytes to a multiple
of 4 bytes in length, or whether this applies only <em>between</em> tables,
and the final table of the file may be left unpadded.
Most current tools and fonts seem to expect all tables to be padded to a 4-byte
boundary, including the last.
The WOFF specification assumes this behavior, and specifies that the
<tt>totalSfntLength</tt> field in the WOFF header provides for such padding.
To ensure that a given font can be packaged as a WOFF file and then decoded
to its original format and give a byte-for-byte identical result,
the input font should therefore be padded to a multiple of 4 bytes in length.</dd>

<dt>No "hidden" data</dt>
<dd>The OpenType/OFF specification does not explicitly prohibit the
presence of "extra" data or padding in between the font tables;
as the table directory includes the offset and length of each actual table,
such data would simply be ignored. However, the WOFF format makes no
provision to preserve such non-font-table data when packaging a font,
and therefore it would not survive a round-trip format conversion.</dd>

<dt>Header fields are correct</dt>
<dd>The OpenType/OFF header fields (<tt>searchRange</tt>,
<tt>entrySelector</tt>, <tt>rangeShift</tt>)
that are designed to facilitate a binary search of the table directory
must be correct in the input sfnt file,
as the WOFF format does not directly preserve these fields
but assumes a WOFF decoder will recompute them as needed.</dd>

<dt>Checksums are correct</dt>
<dd>The WOFF specification says that table checksums must be validated
(and corrected if necessary) by WOFF creators.
In order for complete
round-trip fidelity, therefore, the checksums in the input sfnt file
must also be correct prior to WOFF packaging.</dd>

<dt>No overlapping tables</dt>
<dd>The offset and length values in the input sfnt table directory must not indicate overlapping byte ranges of the input font.</dd>
</dl>

<p>

<!-- need to add to test scheme-->
<span class="conform at" id="conform-identical">The result of creating a WOFF file and then decoding this to
regenerate an sfnt font MUST result in a final font that is bitwise-identical to
the well-formed input font.</span>.
<span class="conform at" id="conform-incorrect-reject">If the input font has defects or anomalies
that make this impossible,
the WOFF-generating tool SHOULD either reject the font
or issue an appropriate warning
that lossless round-trip conversion will not be possible</span>.</p>


<h2 id="DataTables">6.&nbsp;Font Data Tables</h2>

<p>The font data tables in the WOFF file are exactly the same as the tables in
the input font, except that <span class="conform ??" id="conform-maycompress2">each table MAY have been
compressed</span>. If compressed, <span class="conform ff" id="conform-mustzlib">it MUST have been compressed by the <tt>compress2()</tt> function of zlib</span> [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-Compress2">Compress2</a></cite>] (or an
equivalent, compatible algorithm). User agents use the
<tt>uncompress()</tt> function of zlib [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-Uncompress">Uncompress</a></cite>](or an
equivalent, compatible algorithm)
 to decompress each table.
The underlying format these functions use is described in the ZLIB
specification [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-ZLIB">ZLib</a></cite>]. <span class="conform ua" id="conform-mustuncompress">User agents or other programs that decode WOFF files MUST be able to handle
tables that have been compressed</span>.
<span class="conform ua" id="conform-decompressfailure">If the
decompression function fails for any table, the WOFF file is invalid
and MUST NOT be loaded</span>.</p>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-afterdirectory">The font data tables MUST be stored immediately following the table
directory, without gaps except for any padding that is required (up to three
null bytes at the end of each table) to ensure 4-byte alignment</span>.</p>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-sameorder">Font tables in WOFF files MUST be stored in the same order as the well-formed input font</span>.
The table order is implied by <tt>offset</tt> values in the table directory; sorting table
directory entries into ascending <tt>offset</tt> value order
produces a list of entries in an order equivalent to that of the font tables.
</p>

<div class="note">
<p>User agents need not necessarily reconstitute the input font as a whole, and may reorder tables when decoding the WOFF file to sfnt form; they may access individual tables directly as needed. Under these circumstances the resulting sfnt will no longer be an exact copy of the input font, and checksums or digital signature data may be invalidated as a result.</p>

<p>In some cases, sites deploying WOFF files as Web fonts may wish to subset the character
repertoire, optimize table ordering for efficient text layout or rasterization,
or remove (or add) optional font tables depending on the particular features needed for a site.
User agents might make similar modifications to the font during decoding,
such as omitting tables that are not needed by their particular text display system.</p>

<p>The automatic removal of OpenType features such as GPOS and GSUB information
at any stage in the process of deploying a WOFF file is strongly discouraged.
Many writing systems around the world rely on these features
for very basic display of text in the script that they use.</p>

<p>If either a WOFF-creation tool or a WOFF-consuming user agent
reorders or otherwise modifies the collection of font tables,
the font checksum in the <tt>head</tt> table will need to be recalculated
as it will be affected by the changed offsets in
the sfnt table directory.
Any <tt>DSIG</tt> table in the input font will also be invalidated by such changes, and should therefore be removed from the modified font.
A new signature could be added to the modified font,
as described by the OpenType and Open Font Format specifications
(if appropriate signing credentials are available to the tool involved).
Any such pre- and/or post-processing
represents a modification of the font data being packaged;
while it might be done in conjunction with WOFF packaging for Web deployment,
it falls outside the scope of the WOFF specification.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
<p>The OpenType/OFF specification does not explicitly prohibit the
presence of "extra" data or padding in between the font tables in the sfnt format;
as the table directory includes the offset and length of each actual table,
such data would simply be ignored. However, the WOFF format makes no
provision to preserve such "hidden" non-font-table data when packaging a font,
and therefore it would not survive a round-trip format conversion.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Metadata">7.&nbsp;Extended Metadata Block</h2>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-metadata-optional">The WOFF file MAY include a block of extended metadata</span>. This may be more extensive and more easily accesible than metadata present in sfnt tables. The metadata block consists of XML data compressed by
zlib; the file header specifies both the size of the actual compressed and the
original uncompressed size in order to facilitate memory allocation.</p>

<p><span class="conform ua" id="conform-metadata-noeffect">The presence (or absence) and content of the metadata block
MUST NOT affect font loading or rendering behavior of user agents</span>;
it is intended to be purely informative.
<!-- not directly testable-->
<span class="conform ua" id="conform-metadata-maydisplay">User agents MAY provide a means for users to view information about fonts
(such as a "Font Information" panel)</span>. <span class="conform ua" id="conform-metadata-authoritative">If such information is provided,
then they MUST treat the metadata block as the primary source,
and MAY fall back to presenting information from the font's <tt>name</tt>
table entries when relevant extended metadata elements are not present</span>.</p>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-metadata-alwayscompress">If present, the metadata MUST be compressed</span>; it is never stored in
uncompressed form.</p>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-metadata-afterfonttable">The metadata block MUST follow immediately after the last font table</span>. As all font
data tables are padded with up to three null bytes
if needed to reach a 4-byte boundary,
the beginning of the metadata block will always be 4-byte aligned.
<span class="conform ff" id="conform-metadata-noprivatepad">If the metadata block is the last block in the WOFF file,
there SHOULD be no additional padding after the end of the block</span>.</p>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-metadata-wellformed">The extended metadata MUST be well-formed XML</span> <span class="conform ff" id="conform-metadata-encoding">encoded in UTF-8</span>.</p>

<p>The schema for the extended metadata XML is described below.
<span class="conform ff" id="conform-metadata-schemavalid">If the extended metadata does not match this schema,
it is invalid</span>.
<span class="conform ff" id="conform-metadata-decompressible">It is also invalid if it cannot be decompressed
by zlib's <tt>uncompress()</tt> function (or equivalent)</span>,
or <span class="conform ff" id="conform-metaOrigLength"> if the length of the decompressed data does not match the <tt>metaOrigLength</tt> value specified in the WOFF header.</span>
Thus, valid metadata is well formed, conforms to the schema below,
and is stored in compressed form in the WOFF file.
<span class="conform ua" id="conform-invalid-mustignore">
A conforming user agent MUST ignore an invalid metadata block,
as if the block were not present</span>.</p>

<p>This description is also available
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/metadata/woffmeta.rng">as a RelaxNG schema</a>.
In the event of a discrepancy between the RelaxNG schema
and the text of the specification, the text takes precedence.</p>

<p>Several elements store their data in <tt>text</tt>
child elements; this is to support localization. <span class="conform ff" id="conform-textlang">The <tt>text</tt>
elements MAY be given a <tt>lang</tt> attribute
in the XML namespace</span> [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-XML">XML</a></cite>].
For backwards compatibility, <tt>lang</tt> attributes in the default namepsace
are also accepted in older content, and SHOULD be treated the same
as <tt>xml:lang</tt>.
New content SHOULD instead use <tt>xml:lang</tt>.</p>

<p>The syntax of values of the <tt>xml:lang</tt> attribute can be found in
BCP47 [<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#ref-BCP47">BCP47</a></cite>].
A user agent displaying metadata SHOULD choose a preferred language/locale to display from among those available, following BCP47.</p>

<p><span class="conform ua" id="conform-langselect">The user agent SHOULD choose which of the available <tt>text</tt>
elements to display as follows</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a <tt>text</tt> element is available that matches the user's
preferred language, as determined via
an explicit preference or implied by the current locale, use this language.</li>
<li>If the user agent has a concept of a list of "acceptable" languages or
defaults, try each of these in turn and use the first one for which a match found.</li>
<li>If there is a <tt>text</tt> element with no <tt>xml:lang</tt>
attribute, use this; in the event that more than one exists, use the first of them.</li>
<li>If no match is found yet, use the first <tt>text</tt> element.

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#appendix-a">Appendix A</a> includes several examples
of the content of the metadata block.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Although the metadata block is optional,
and there is no requirement for user agents to process it
in order to render the font,
clients such as Web browsers are encouraged to provide a means
(such as a "Font Information" dialog for the current page)
for users to view the metadata included in WOFF files.
Not every client will necessarily have an appropriate context for this,
but any client that enables the user to find out about the resources used by a Web document
should consider exposing information about the fonts used, and in the case of
WOFF-packaged fonts, the metadata block is the primary source of this information.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Private">8.&nbsp;Private Data Block</h2>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-private">The WOFF file MAY include a block of arbitrary data</span>, allowing font creators
to include whatever information they wish. <span class="conform ua" id="conform-private-noeffect">The content of this data MUST NOT
affect font usage or load behavior of user agents</span>.
User agents should make no assumptions
about the content of a private block; it may (for example) contain ASCII or
Unicode text, or some vendor-defined binary data, and it may be compressed or
encrypted, but it has no publicly defined format. Conformant user agents will
not assume anything about the structure of this data. Only the font developer or
vendor responsible for the private block is expected to understand its
contents.</p>

<p><span class="conform ff" id="conform-private-last">The private data block, if present, MUST be the last block in the WOFF file,
following all the font tables and any extended metadata block</span>. 
<span class="conform ff" id="conform-private-padalign">The private data

bytes inserted as padding after any preceding metadata block

<p>Here is an example of how the <tt>div</tt> element could be used,
modified from a portion of the
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/webfonts/WOFF/spec/metadata/GentiumPlus-WOFF-metadata.xml">XML file for Gentium Plus</a>
which, when viewed as plain text, has paragraph formatting.</p>

<p>The original metadata file contained:</p>
<div class="metadata">
<pre>&lt;description&gt;
 &lt;text lang="en"&gt;
	Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family 
	designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use 
	the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts to produce readable, high-quality
	publications. The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably
	compact, and visually attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence
	in Typeface Design" in two major international typeface design competitions: 
	bukva:raz! (2001), TDC2003 (2003).

	The Gentium Plus font family is based on the original design. It currently 
	comes with regular and italic face only, although additional weights are in
	development.

	The goal for this product is to provide a single Unicode-based font family
	that contains a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
	Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
	orthographic needs, and provide a matching Greek face. In addition, there
	is provision for other characters and symbols useful to linguists. This
	font makes use of state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex
	typographic issues, such as the need to position arbitrary combinations
	of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.

   (and so on)

<h2 id="appendix-b">Appendix B: Media Type registration</h2>

Security considerations:</dt><dd>
<p>
Fonts are interpreted data structures that represent collections of glyph outlines, metrics and layout information for various languages and writing systems. Currently, there are many standardized font data tables that allow an unspecified number of entries, and where existing, predefined data fields allow storage of binary data with variable length. There is a significant risk that the flexibility of font data structures may be exploited to hide malicious binary content disguised as a font data component.</p>

<p>WOFF is based on the table-based SFNT (scalable font) format which is highly extensible and offers an opportunity to introduce additional data structures when needed. However, this same extensibility may present specific security concerns – the flexibility and ease of defining new data structures makes it easy for any arbitrary data to be added and hidden inside a font file.</p>

<p>WOFF fonts may contain 'hints' for the alignment of graphical elements of the glyphs with the target display pixel grid, and depending on the font technology utilized in the creation of a font these hints may represent active code interpreted and executed by the font rasterizer. Even though they operate within the confines of the glyph outline conversion system and have no access outside the font rendering machinery, hint instructions can be, however, quite complex, and a maliciously designed complex font could cause undue resource consumption (e.g. memory or CPU cycles) on a machine interpreting it. Indeed, fonts are sufficiently complex that most if not all interpreters cannot be completely protected from malicious fonts without undue performance penalties.</p>

<p>Widespread use of fonts as necessary component of visual content presentation warrants that a careful attention should be given to security considerations whenever a font is either embedded into an electronic document or transmitted alongside media content as a linked resource.</p>

<p>WOFF uses gzip compression. The WOFF header contains the uncompressed length of each compressed table. Applications may therefore constrain the size of memory buffer allocated for decompression and may stop writing if a maliciously crafted WOFF file in fact contains more data than is indicated.
</p>

<p>WOFF does not provide privacy protections internally; if needed, these should be provided externally.</p>
 
<p>WOFF has a private data block facility, which may contain
  arbitrary binary data. WOFF does not provide a means to access
  this, or to execute any code contained therein. WOFF 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#conform-private-noeffect">requires</a> that
   the content of this block not affect font rendering in any way.

<h2 id="changes">Appendix C: Changes</h2>

<p>The following changes have been made, relative to the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-WOFF-20100727">27 July 2010 First Public Working Draft</a>. No new features have been added, except for optional enhancements to the metadata format; the remaining changes are clarifications and corrections to existing features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clarified that WOFF is a font <em>packaging</em> or wrapper format, not a new font format as such.</li>
<li>Clarified padding and byte-alignment requirements throughout</li>
<li>Preferred the term 'input font' rather than 'original file' to describe
the font which is converted to WOFF</li>
<li>Clarified that any subsetting, checksum-correction, or DSIG invalidating changes <em>prior</em> to WOFF conversion are out of scope for the WOFF specification.</li>
<li>Clarified meaning of totalSfntSize.</li>
<li>Defined what is meant by a well formed input font.</li>
<li>Clarified meaning of 'invalid metadata' - must be well-formed, compressed, and conform to the schema.</li>
<li>Clarified which elements and attributes in the XML are required;
for elements, clarified their required parents.</li>
<li>Clarified that the id attribute is not of type ID in the XML sense</li>
<li>Added link to a RelaxNG grammar, which tries to express the same constraints as the prose in a machine-readable manner. The prose is normative in case of any difference.</li>
<li>Added reminder to check for overflow when decompressing.</li>
<li>Added a Media Type registration template as required by <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/registering-mediatype.html">W3C Media Type registration</a> policies.</li>
<li>Separated normative and informative references.</li>
<li>Switched to upper-case for RFC-2119 keywords.</li>
<li>Added id and class attributes to all testable assertions.</li>
<li>Added some non-normative explanatory notes.</li>
<li>Minor clarifications to wording throughout.</li>
<li>Some re-ordering of text to group related assertions or to improve readability; in particular, the best practices were previously an appendix and are now integrated into the main body of the specification.</li>
<li>Added this Changes appendix.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following changes were made as a result of Last Call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language attributes now reference BCP47, and use <tt>xml:lang</tt>.</li>
<li>Added optional <tt>div</tt> and <tt>span</tt> elements that can be used to provide structure within metadata text.</li>
<li>Added <tt>dir</tt> and <tt>class</tt> attributes to metadata elements.</li>
<li>Removed summary of conformance requirements (duplicated material from the main body of the specification).</li>
<li>Somewhat rearranged and clarified description of the metadata format.</li>
<li>Noted that same-origin requirements are at risk, in the expectation that CSS3 Fonts will handle this instead.</li>
<li>Mention the need to compute the binary search fields when reconstructing an sfnt header.</li>
<li>Require that metadata be encoded in UTF-8, rather than allowing either UTF-8 or UTF-16.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/webfonts/WOFF/spec/Overview.html.diff?r1=1.58;r2=1.96;f=h">color-coded diff</a> between the editors draft used to prepare the Last Call Working Draft, and the editors draft used to prepare the Candidate Recommendation, is available.</p>

<p>The following changes were made after publication of the Candidate Recommendation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed (previously at-risk) text specifying same-origin requirements
for loading WOFF fonts, and CORS mechanism to relax the restriction,
as the CSS WG agreed to include this in CSS3 Fonts
as part of the specification of the @font-face rule.</li>
<li>Moved CSS3-Fonts from normative to informative section, due to removal of at-risk items.</li>
<li>Corrected erroneous use of MUST in a general introductory statement</li>
</ul>

<p> A <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/webfonts/WOFF/spec/Overview.html.diff?r1=1.99;r2=1.112;f=h">color-coded diff</a> between the editors draft used to prepare the Candidate Recommendation, and the editors draft used to prepare the Proposed Recommendation, is available.</p>

<p id="changes-postPR">The following changes were made after publication of the Proposed Recommendation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The security considerations section of the Media Type Registration appendix was updated to point into the body of the specification,
alerting the reader to the private data block and indicating that WOFF does not provide a mechanism to execute any binary code that might be
contained therein. This change was made at the request of the IANA Expert Reviewer.</li>

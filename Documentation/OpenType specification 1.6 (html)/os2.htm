If the bit is set (1) then the Unicode range is considered functional. If the bit is clear (0) then the range is not considered functional. Each of the bits is treated as an independent flag and the bits can be set in any combination. The determination of &ldquo;functional&rdquo; is left up to the font designer, although character set selection should attempt to be functional by ranges if at all possible. <br><br><b>All reserved fields must be zero.</b> Each long is in Big-Endian form. See ISO/IEC 10646 or the most recent version of the Unicode Standard for the list of Unicode ranges and characters.</td>

It is also likely that the vendors will have other inherent benefits in their fonts (more kern pairs, unregularized data, hand hinted, etc.).

          <td>All undefined bits must be zero. <br><br> Bits 1-4 are rarely used bits that indicate the font is primarily a decorative or special purpose font. <br><br>If bit 6 is set, then bits 0 and 5 must be clear, else the behavior is undefined. As noted above, the settings of bits 0 and 1 must be reflected in the macStyle bits in the 'head' table. While bit 6 on implies that bits 0 and 1 of macStyle are clear (along with bits 0 and 5 of fsSelection), the reverse is not true. Bits 0 and 1 of macStyle (and 0 and 5 of fsSelection) may be clear and that does not give any indication of whether or not bit 6 of fsSelection is clear (e.g., Arial Light would have all bits cleared; it is not the regular version of Arial). <br><br> Bit 7 was specified in OS/2 table v. 4. If fonts created with an earlier version of the OS/2 table are updated to the current version of the OS/2 table, then, in order to minimize potential reflow of existing documents which use the fonts, the bit would be set only for fonts for which using the OS/2.usWin* metrics for line height would yield significantly inferior results than using the OS/2.sTypo* values. New fonts, however, are not constrained by backward compatibility situations, and so are free to set this bit always. <br><br>If bit 8 is set in OS/2 table v. 4, then &lsquo;name&rsquo; strings for family and subfamily are provided that are consistent with a weight/width/slope family model without requiring the use of &lsquo;name&rsquo; IDs 21 or 22. <br><br>Many typographic families contains faces that differ only in one or more of the attributes weight, width and slope. Even though a family might have a large number of member faces, if the variations are in these attributes only, then family and subfamily names provided in the &lsquo;name&rsquo; table using IDs 1 and 2 or 16 and 17 will be consistent with a weight/width/slope family model. If the names in these IDs are consistent with a weight/width/slope model, then bit 8 should be set, and &lsquo;name&rsquo; entries for name IDs 21 and 22 should not be included.<br><br> Some typographic families include faces that differ in attributes other than weight, width or slope. For example, a family might include variations for &ldquo;handwriting&rdquo;, &ldquo;caption&rdquo;, &ldquo;display&rdquo;, &ldquo;optical size&rdquo;, etc. In this case, some of the member faces may differ from the Regular face only in weight, width or slope attributes, while other members will differ in relation to other attributes. Fonts for those member faces that differ from Regular only in weight, width or slope should have bit 8 set, and should not use name ID 21 or 22, as described above. But the fonts for those member faces that differ from Regular in terms of other attributes should not have bit 8 set, and they should use name IDs 21 and 22 to map these faces into a WWS-conformant family model.<br><br> Thus, if a font has a v. 4 OS/2 table, bit 8 should be set if and only if &lsquo;name&rsquo; entries for IDs 16 and 17 are consistent with the WWS model and entries for IDs 21 and 22 are not included. Conversely, if bit 8 is not set, that will be interpreted to mean that the names provided by IDs 16 and 17 are not consistent with the WWS model and that &lsquo;name&rsquo; entries for IDs 21 and 22 are included. <br><br>This bit must be unset in OS/2 table versions less than 4. In these cases, it is not possible to determine any information about the typographic family&rsquo;s attributes by examining this bit. <br><br>In this context, &ldquo;typographic family&rdquo; is the Microsoft Unicode string for name ID 16, if present, else the Microsoft Unicode string for name ID 1; &ldquo;weight&rdquo; is OS/2.usWeightClass; &ldquo;width&rdquo; is OS/2.usWidthClass; &ldquo;slope&rdquo; is OS/2.fsSelection bit 0 (ITALIC) and bit 9 (OBLIQUE). <br><br>If bit 9 is set in OS/2 table v. 4, then this font is to be considered an &ldquo;oblique&rdquo; style by processes which make a distinction between oblique and italic styles, e.g. Cascading Style Sheets font matching. For example, a font created by algorithmically slanting an upright face will set this bit. <br><br>If unset in OS/2 table v. 4, then this font is not to be considered an &ldquo;oblique&rdquo; style. For example, a font that has a classic italic design will not set this bit. <br><br>This bit must be unset in OS/2 table versions less than 4. In these cases, it is not possible to determine any information about this font's attributes by examining this bit. <br><br>This bit, unlike the ITALIC bit, is not related to style-linking for Windows GDI or Mac OS applications in a traditional four-member family of regular, italic, bold and bold italic.&ldquo;. It may be set or unset independently of the ITALIC bit. In most cases, if OBLIQUE is set, then ITALIC will also be set, though this is not required.</td>

          <td>Description:</td>
          <td>This metric specifies the distance between the baseline and the approximate height of uppercase letters measured in FUnits. This value would normally be specified by a type designer but in situations where that is not possible, for example when a legacy font is being converted, the value may be set equal to the top of the unscaled and unhinted glyph bounding box of the glyph encoded at U+0048 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H). If no glyph is encoded in this position the field should be set to 0. <br><br> This metric, if specified, can be used in systems that specify type size by capital height measured in millimeters. It can also be used as an alignment metric; the top of a drop capital, for instance, can be aligned to the sCapHeight metric of the first line of text.</td>

          <td>The maximum length of a target glyph context for any feature in this font. For example, a font which has only a pair kerning feature should set this field to 2. If the font also has a ligature feature in which the glyph sequence 'f f i' is substituted by the ligature 'ffi', then this field should be set to 3. This field could be useful to sophisticated line-breaking engines in determining how far they should look ahead to test whether something could change that effects the line breaking. For chaining contextual lookups, the length of the string (covered glyph) + (input sequence) + (lookahead sequence) should be considered.</td>

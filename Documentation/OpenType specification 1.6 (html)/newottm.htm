            <b>EXHIBIT A. Guidelines for use of the OpenType&trade; Mark</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> COMPANY may use the Mark solely on Product packaging as well as in advertising (including Web advertising), collateral, and marketing materials for Product(s) to indicate that Product includes or is compatible with fonts that meet the MICROSOFT OpenType font technology.
                    </li>
            <li> COMPANY may use the Mark solely as part of the phrase &ldquo;OpenType&trade; fonts&rdquo; to identify fonts compliant with the OpenType font specifications; COMPANY may not use the Mark as part of COMPANY's name or Product name.
                    </li>
            <li> The Mark may not be used in any manner that expresses or might imply MICROSOFT's affiliation with or sponsorship, endorsement, certification, or approval of COMPANY or Product(s). COMPANY's trade name, logo, or Product name must appear at least as prominent as the Mark on any materials.
                    </li>
            <li> COMPANY shall not use the Mark in association with any of COMPANY's trademarks in any manner that might suggest co-branding or otherwise create potential confusion as to source or sponsorship of the Product(s) or ownership of the Mark.
                    </li>
            <li> The Mark may not be combined with COMPANY's own trade name, domain name, product or service name, logos, icons, graphics, photos, or other design elements or trademarks.
                    </li>
            <li> MICROSOFT's logos, logotypes, trade dress, and other elements of product packaging and websites may not be imitated in any manner in COMPANY's products, product packaging, websites, or other materials.
                    </li>
            <li> COMPANY shall mark the first and most prominent use of the Mark on Product packaging and in each collateral material, including in advertising and marketing, with the trademark symbol &trade; as follows: &ldquo;OpenType&trade;&rdquo;, or other appropriate trademark designations set forth from time to time by MICROSOFT.
                    </li>
            <li> The Mark shall be attributed to Microsoft Corporation in all materials where it is used, with the attribution clause: <i>&ldquo;OpenType is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and other countries.&rdquo;</i></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Quality Control</h2>
      <p> MICROSOFT reserves the right to review Product quality and compatibility, and use of the Mark. MICROSOFT may conduct spot checks on all Product packaging, advertising, collateral materials, and marketing materials, and may periodically send out requests for samples. COMPANY must provide MICROSOFT with samples promptly upon request by MICROSOFT. COMPANY must also submit to MICROSOFT on a quarterly basis, i.e., by March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year during the term of the Agreement, an updated list of COMPANY's Products that meet the OpenType font specifications and with which COMPANY plans to use the Mark.</p>
      <p> Send these items to: Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, USA. Attention: David M. Meltzer, MS Typography. Fax:(425) 936-7329</p>
      <p> Refusal to submit samples or non-compliance with your Agreement and/or with the guidelines in this Exhibit or as may be provided by MICROSOFT from time to time could result in revocation of your license to use the Mark. </p>

      <p>NOTE: This is maintained for purposes of being able to validate version 2 OS/2 tables.</p>
      <p>The OS/2 table consists of a set of metrics that are required in OpenType fonts. There are two versions of this table, the second version having five additional fields: sxHeight, sCapHeight, usDefaultChar, usBreakChar, usMaxContext. The layout of version 2 of this table is as follows:</p>

For proportionally spaced fonts, this value is useful in estimating the length for lines of text. The weighting factors provided with this example are only valid for Latin lowercase letters. If other character sets, or capital letters are used, the corresponding frequency of use values should be used. One needs to be careful when comparing fonts that use different frequency of use values for font mapping. The average character width for the following set of upper and lowercase letters only, is calculated according to this formula: Sum the individual character widths multiplied by the following weighting factors and then divide by 1000.

If the font is a symbol font, the first byte of the PANOSE number (bFamilyType) must be set to &ldquo;pictorial.&rdquo; Good PANOSE values in fonts are very valuable to users of the Windows fonts folder.

          <td>Description:</td>
          <td>The maximum length of a target glyph context for any feature in this font. For example, a font which has only a pair kerning feature should set this field to 2. If the font also has a ligature feature in which the glyph sequence 'f f i' is substituted by the ligature 'ffi', then this field should be set to 3. This field could be useful to sophisticated line-breaking engines in determining how far they should look ahead to test whether something could change that effects the line breaking. For chaining contextual lookups, the length of the string (covered glyph) + (input sequence) + (lookahead sequence) should be considered.</td>

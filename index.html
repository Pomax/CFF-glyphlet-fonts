<h1>Let's make a font</h1>

<p>We all use fonts every day, and we don't even have to bother noticing. Text looks pretty
(okay, sometimes it looks horrible) and that's pretty much the extent of our interaction with
fonts. We take them for granted, and that's a good thing: they're not just easy to use, we
simply don't care how they work because we don't need to. They just work, and we don't have
to think about whatever complexities are involved in actually getting text styled using a
specific font.</p>

<p>But, sometimes you want to dive into a subject for a bit to find out how something that
you take for granted in every day life works. How does your car's engine work? Where does
milk come from? Why do clocks show 12 instead of 24 steps? Do dolphins even sleep?</p>

<p>Or, in this case, how does a font work? In order to best see how a font works, we're
actually going to "roll our own" font. And not the simple kind either, we're going to
make our own OpenType font (if you've ever seen a font file and it ended in .ttf or .otf,
those are OpenType fonts. It's the defacto standard in font land), using Adobe Type2
charstrings, which are a very rich —but also generally complex— way to specify vector
graphics.</p>

<h2>Let's look at a font from the ground up</h2>

<p>First off, let's quickly generate a small font that we can use to examine how they're
built up, and how they work:</p>

<script>
var asHex = function(v) { v = v.toString(16).toUpperCase(); if(v.length === 1) v = "0" + v; return v; };
var asChars = function(v) { return String.fromCharCode(v); };
function makeTable(data, limit) {
  limit = limit || 16;
  var table = document.createElement("table");
  for(var i=0, end = data.length; i*limit<end; i++) {
    var row = document.createElement("tr");
    var prefix = document.createElement("td");
    prefix.innerHTML = (i*16)|0;
    prefix.style.background = "rgba(100,180,220,0.3)";
    prefix.style.textAlign = "right";
    row.appendChild(prefix)

    var entries = data.slice(limit*i, limit*(i+1));
    var addColumn = function(entry) {
      var column = document.createElement("td");
      column.innerHTML = entry;
      row.appendChild(column);
    };
    entries.forEach(addColumn);
    var len = 16 - entries.length;
    if(len>0) {
      (new Array(len+1)).join('—').split('').forEach(addColumn);
    }
    table.appendChild(row);
  }
  return table;
};
var binary = buildFont({
  outline: "M 20 20 L 20 1004 1004 1004 1004 20 Z",
  quadSize: 1024
});
var hexmap = binary.map(asHex);
console.log(hexmap.join(" "));
var charmap = binary.map(asChars);
document.body.appendChild(makeTable(hexmap));
document.body.appendChild(makeTable(charmap));
</script>

<p>The above two tables are fonts. Seriously! The one on the left shows you the bytecode
for a custom font that was just made, right now, on this page (<em>in fact, if you keep
your page-reload hotkeys pressed, you'll see two values change, identically, as the number
of seconds since January 1st 1969 increases</em>). On the right the same bytecode has
been turned into letters, but not every byte has a corresponding letter, because the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1">8859-1 codepage</a>, the standard
byte-to-letter table on modern computers, doesn't assign a readable letter to every
number that a byte can represent (which is the numbers 0 through 255). The bytecode
00, for instance, has no equivalent letter, while bytecode 41 (representing a base-16
value, so actually the decimal value 65) is the letter "A".</p>

    <h1>Let's make a font</h1>

    <p>We all use fonts every day, and we don't even have to bother noticing. Text looks pretty
    (okay, sometimes it looks horrible) and that's pretty much the extent of our interaction with
    fonts. We take them for granted, and that's a good thing: they're not just easy to use, we
    simply don't care how they work because we don't need to. They just work, and we don't have
    to think about whatever complexities are involved in actually getting text styled using a
    specific font.</p>

    <p>But, sometimes you want to dive into a subject for a bit to find out how something that
    you take for granted in every day life works. How does your car's engine work? Where does
    milk come from? Why do clocks show 12 instead of 24 steps? Do dolphins even sleep?</p>

    <p>Or, in this case, how does a font work? In order to best see how a font works, we're
    actually going to "roll our own" font. And not the simple kind either, we're going to
    make our own OpenType font (if you've ever seen a font file and it ended in .ttf or .otf,
    those are OpenType fonts. It's the defacto standard in font land), using Adobe Type2
    charstrings, which are a very rich —but also generally complex— way to specify vector
    graphics.</p>

    <h2>Let's look at a font from the ground up</h2>

    <p>First off, let's quickly generate a small font that we can use to examine how they're
    built up, and how they work:</p>

    <script src="buildTablesNow.js"></script>

    <p>The above two tables are fonts. Seriously! The one on the left shows you the bytecode
    for a custom font that was just made, right now, on this page. On the right the same bytecode has
    been turned into letters, but not every byte has a corresponding letter, because the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1">8859-1 codepage</a>, the standard
    byte-to-letter table on modern computers, doesn't assign a readable letter to every
    number that a byte can represent (which is the numbers 0 through 255). The bytecode
    00, for instance, has no equivalent letter, while bytecode 41 (representing a base-16
    value, so actually the decimal value 65) is the letter "A".</p>

    <p>So, let's test that font. If all went well, this is a black rectangle: <span style="font-family: 'custom font';">A</span>.</p>
